# Systems Log Analysis Project

## TOPIC: IT System Log Analyzer

### Description:

- CRPF units/offices and personnel are deployed in different location of CRPF. There is no centralised system to analyze the log of IT system by the experts to access threats and breaches. Proposed Solution: Centralized system should be developed for analyzing the systems deployed at the different location of the country Expert per problems statement.

### Project Structure:

- The analyzer must be able to do the scanning of the connected systems and give us the reports for each computer.

- The Report will provide the information in one complete overview, which will contains the information about system: ***from high critical condition to low critical condition***.

- The Report **Main Matter** will tell us about the overall system condition, and is it safe at it's condition to be able work safely with it.
